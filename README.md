   * Continuity
   * Closure
   * Figure & Ground
4. **Create a mobile layout** using appropriate UI elements (buttons, cards, icons, navigation).
5. **Create a web layout** following responsive design patterns (grid, sections, hierarchy).
6. **Use design patterns** such as:

   * Hamburger Menu
   * Card Layout
   * CTA Button (Call-To-Action)
   * Icon-based navigation
7. **Develop interaction behaviors** (hover effects, tap feedback, navigation flow).
8. **Add usability principles:**

   * Consistency
   * Visibility of system status
   * User control
   * Simplicity
9. **Design a brand logo using Canva** following color, typography, and theme guidelines.
10. **Export the designs and add them to the GitHub repository**.
